The length of the array must always evaluate to a non-negative constant that can be represented as a value of the int data type.
In Go unlike in other imperative languages the size of the array is part of its type, which in part limits its expressive power hence you will not often use them in your programs.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://parish.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 19 Apr 2019 21:37:58 +0530</pubDate><guid>https://parish.github.io/about/</guid><description>Hey there!
