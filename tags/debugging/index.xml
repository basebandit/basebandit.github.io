By debugging I mean using an actual debugger ( usually integrated into most IDEs or shipped with some programming languages nowadays or provided as a third party library ).
We both have to agree on one thing, Software development as much as it is fun it is not the most straight forward of jobs.</description></item></channel></rss>
